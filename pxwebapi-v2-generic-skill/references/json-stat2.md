# json-stat2 — format reference

json-stat2 is an open format for statistical datasets (https://json-stat.org/). It is used by PxWebApi v2 but also by other statistical providers such as Eurostat and World Bank. This file documents the format itself — installation-specific operational details (publishing times, limits, rate limiting) belong in `api-details.md`.

In v2, **both** `/tables/{id}/metadata` and `/tables/{id}/data` return a json-stat2 Dataset. They are not the same document, and several fields mean different things in each — see "Metadata response vs data response" below.

## Dataset structure

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "class": "dataset",
  "label": "Table title",
  "source": "Agency name",
  "updated": "2026-02-25T07:00:00Z",
  "note": ["Free-text notes about the table"],
  "id": ["Region", "ContentsCode", "Tid"],
  "size": [1, 1, 5],
  "dimension": { … },
  "value": [100, 200, 300, 400, 500],
  "status": { "3": ".." },
  "role": { "time": ["Tid"], "geo": ["Region"], "metric": ["ContentsCode"] },
  "extension": { "px": { … }, "contact": [ … ] },
  "link": { "describedby": [ … ] }
}
```

### Key elements

- **`id`** — variable names in order.
- **`size`** — number of values per variable, same order as `id`.
- **`value`** — flat array of all data values in **row-major order**: the last dimension in `id` varies fastest, the first varies slowest (the C/NumPy convention). For `size = [s₀, s₁, …, sₙ]` and category indices `(i₀, i₁, …, iₙ)`, the flat index is `i₀·(s₁·s₂·…·sₙ) + i₁·(s₂·…·sₙ) + … + iₙ`. Category positions come from `dimension.{var}.category.index`.
- **`dimension`** — per variable: codes (`category.index`), labels (`category.label`), units (`category.unit`), per-value notes (`category.note`), and `extension`.
- **`role`** — which variables are `time`, `geo` and `metric`. **Start your analysis here** (see below).
- **`status`** — special values, keyed by index into `value`; the corresponding `value` entry is `null`.
- **`note`** — an **array** of table-level caveats. Read it before interpreting a series: boundary changes, base-year changes and coverage gaps are recorded here. See "Notes" below — some of them are mandatory to display.
- **`extension`** — installation-specific metadata, at two levels. See below.
- **`link`** — classification and definition references. See below.

Older serializers may omit `"version": "2.0"`. The rest of the structure is unaffected.

---

## Start the analysis with `role`

- **`role.metric`** — what is being measured. In Nordic installations this is usually a variable named `ContentsCode`, but **check `role.metric` for the actual name** rather than assuming — other installations differ. Read `dimension.{metric}.category.unit` for the unit and the number of decimals.
- **`role.time`** — the time dimension.
- **`role.geo`** — geography. **If `role.geo` is missing, the figures cover the installation's whole country or area — do not ask the user.**
- Variables in `id` but not in `role` are breakdown dimensions — sex, age, industry, and so on.

---

## `extension` — two levels, not one

`extension` appears both at the **dataset** level and inside **each dimension**, and the two carry different things. Confusing them is the most common misreading of a PxWeb json-stat2 document.

### Dataset level (`extension` in the root)

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `px` | PX header keywords — see next section |
| `contact` | Structured contact details for the statistic |
| `noteMandatory` | Which entries in the root `note` array must be displayed — see "Notes" |
| `discontinued` | Whether the table is closed. Often `null`; present in data responses |

**`firstPeriod`, `lastPeriod` and the table's `discontinued` flag are fields of the `/tables` search hit, not of the dataset.** If you need the table's coverage before fetching data, read them from `GET /tables?query=…`, not from the json-stat2 document.

### Dimension level (`dimension.{var}.extension`)

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `elimination` | Whether the dimension may be omitted from a query — **metadata only**, see the trap below |
| `eliminationValueCode` | The code that represents the total, when one exists — **data responses only**, see the trap below |
| `codelists` | Available aggregations (`agg_`) and valuesets (`vs_`) for this dimension, with labels and links |
| `show` | How the agency intends values to be labelled: `value`, `code`, `code_value` |
| `refperiod` | Reference period per value, e.g. a stock measured at 1 January |
| `measuringType` | `Stock`, `Flow`, `Average`, … — what kind of quantity this is |
| `priceType` | Current prices, fixed prices, or not applicable |
| `adjustment` | Seasonal / working-day adjustment, or `None` |
| `basePeriod` | The base period of an index, e.g. `2025=100` |
| `alternativeText` | An alternative label supplied by the agency |
| `noteMandatory`, `categoryNoteMandatory` | Which dimension- or value-level notes must be displayed |

`measuringType`, `priceType`, `adjustment` and `basePeriod` decide how a number may honestly be described. An index without its base period is meaningless; a fixed-price series compared against a current-price one is wrong. Read them before writing the sentence that explains what the figure means.

### Trap: eliminability is readable only from the metadata response

`extension.elimination` answers a **different question** in each response type (verified on two installations, 2026-08-30):

- **In a metadata response** it is the contract: *may this dimension be left out of a query?* This is the one you want.
- **In a data response** it describes the extract you just received: it is `true` only when the value set that came back still contains the elimination value, and `false` otherwise. Select one ordinary region and it reads `false`; apply a codelist and it reads `false`; and neither says anything about whether the dimension was eliminable.

So **never infer eliminability from a data response.** Re-read the metadata instead.

The same asymmetry runs the other way for `eliminationValueCode`, which is why a table can look as if it has no total code when it has one. PX has two elimination forms and the metadata response does not distinguish them:

- `ELIMINATION=YES` — there is no total value; the API sums the dimension on the fly when you omit it. (A sex dimension whose only categories are "women" and "men".)
- `ELIMINATION("<value>")` — a predefined total value already exists in the value set. (A region dimension carrying a "whole country" code alongside the municipalities.)

In metadata both appear as a bare `elimination: true` — `eliminationValueCode` was absent from every dimension across a 50-table sweep. A **data** response that includes the total is what reveals it, as `eliminationValueCode: "<code>"`. If you need to know which form a dimension uses, that probe is the way to find out.

## `extension.px` — PX keywords inside the dataset

PxWeb adds a non-standard `px` object to the dataset-level `extension`, carrying part of the source PX file's header:

```json
"extension": {
  "px": { "tableid": "…", "matrix": "…", "decimals": 1,
          "aggregallowed": false, "official-statistics": true,
          "heading": ["ContentsCode", "Tid"], "stub": ["Region"],
          "subject-code": "pp", "subject-area": "Prices and price indices",
          "contents": "…", "language": "en", "copyright": true }
}
```

Useful fields:

- **`aggregallowed`** — whether summing this table is meaningful at all. This is the only place the answer appears. It is commonly `false` for index tables, where adding index points produces nonsense. Treat it as a signal about interpretation, **not** as a technical block: an installation may still offer codelists on such a table and answer HTTP 200 for them.
- **`decimals`** — the table's default decimal count (per-value decimals live in `category.unit`).
- **`heading` / `stub`** — the pivot layout the agency intends, i.e. which variables belong in columns and which in rows. Useful when rendering a table the way its publisher does.
- **`subject-code` / `subject-area`** — the subject classification.

This is a PxWeb extension — do not expect it from other json-stat producers.

## Notes

Two levels, and both may be **mandatory to display**:

- **`note`** (root) — an array of table-level notes. `extension.noteMandatory` is keyed by index into that array: `{"1": true}` means `note[1]` must be shown to the user. The index differs per table, so resolve it rather than assuming the first note.
- **`category.note`** (inside a dimension) — notes attached to individual values, gated by `extension.categoryNoteMandatory` in the same way. This is where boundary changes and definition breaks are recorded, per value.

Mandatory notes are how an agency warns that a figure needs a caveat — a changed base year, a corrected period, a discontinued table with a successor. They travel with the **data** response too, so displaying them costs no extra call. If a note is flagged mandatory and your answer computes something the note is about, the note belongs in the answer.

---

## Units and decimals

```json
"ContentsCode": {
  "label": "statistical variable",
  "category": {
    "index": { "Persons1": 0 },
    "label": { "Persons1": "Persons" },
    "unit":  { "Persons1": { "base": "number", "decimals": 0 } }
  },
  "extension": { "elimination": false, "measuringType": { "Persons1": "Stock" } }
}
```

`unit.base` is the unit of measurement and `unit.decimals` how many decimals to display. Keep that precision: do not add decimals the agency did not publish, and do not round away ones that carry meaning.

---

## Status codes

`status` maps an index in `value` to a symbol; the corresponding `value` entry is `null`.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `.` | Not applicable — the category did not exist when the data was collected |
| `..` | Data not available — not yet in the database |
| `:` | Confidential — withheld to avoid identifying a person or business |

Exact symbols vary by installation, because they come from the source PX file's `DATASYMBOL1`–`6` keywords and each file may override the defaults. Check the response. **Never treat any of them as zero**, and never silently drop the row.

---

## Classification links

Some agencies attach classification URNs to `link.describedby`:

```json
"link": { "describedby": [ { "extension": { "Region": "urn:…:classification:…:104" } } ] }
```

The `extension` key is either a variable name (a URN for the whole variable) or a single value code (a URN per value — common for the metric variable). Some installations additionally publish ready-made human-readable links under `link.related` in metadata responses; availability varies by installation, so check rather than assume.

## What json-stat2 cannot express

The loss is silent in all three cases:

- **Time periodicity.** PX declares it explicitly (`TIMEVAL(...)=TLIST(A1|H1|Q1|M1|W1)`, which also guarantees consecutive periods). json-stat2 has no standard field for it — `role.time` names the time dimension but says nothing about its frequency. PxWebApi v2 works around this with **`timeUnit` on the `/tables` resource, *outside* the json-stat2 document**. If a consumer downstream needs to know whether an axis is monthly or quarterly, carry `timeUnit` across yourself; the dataset will not.
- **The aggregation that produced a figure.** An omitted dimension is eliminated and **disappears from `id` and `dimension` entirely** — the dataset does not record that it was summed away, or over what.
- **Which codelist a code came from.** Requesting `codelist[Var]=agg_…` leaves no trace in the response: the dimension comes back with the aggregated codes and an `extension` that names no codelist. Two different aggregations of the same variable produce datasets that look alike and are not.

All three are reasons to state your selection alongside your numbers rather than relying on the response to document itself.

## Tooling

Client libraries exist for JavaScript, Python, R, Java and Julia — see https://json-stat.org/. Useful in practice:

- **Python** — `pyjstat` converts json-stat into pandas DataFrames.
- **R** — `rjstat`. SSB additionally publishes `PxWebApiData` on CRAN, which reads PxWeb data from Statistics Norway, Statistics Sweden and Statistics Finland. It supports **both API versions** (1.9.0, 2026-02-02) and ships a separate vignette for each. The v2 interface is snake_case — `api_data()`, `get_api_data()`, `query_url()`, plus `meta_frames()`, `meta_code_list()` and `meta_data()`, each with `_1`/`_2`/`_12` variants returning labels, codes or both — against v1's camelCase `ApiData()`.
- **Node.js** — the json-stat Toolkit's command-line converters (`jsonstat2csv`, `csv2jsonstat`, `jsonstat2arrow`, `sdmx2jsonstat`, …). `jsonstat2csv` gives better control over separators and decimal characters than the API's own CSV output.
- **Browsing** — the json-stat explorer at https://json-stat.com/explorer, plus a JSON viewer extension (built into Firefox; jsonview.com for Chromium).
